# Multigrid solver for Poisson's equation in 2D
This project was an assignment for a HPC course that I took in March 2010 (a long time ago!). I
worked on this project together with Daniel Elfverson and Gustav Persarvet. Back then, we were
students in the engineering physics master's degree program at Uppsala University, Sweden. 

I have left much of the original source code intact, including spelling and grammar mistakes and mix
of Swedish/English. The only change I did was to reformat the source code using clang format because it
was pretty unreadable otherwise. The code can be compiled with the provided Makefile.
